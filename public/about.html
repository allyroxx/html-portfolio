<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Aaliyah McInnis and I've been working in Marketing for the past 9 years, with a focus on Influencer Marketing for the last 6 years. 
I've helped content creators and brands scale their business and Over the last 3 years, I’ve worked directly with creators such as The Tillery’s, Jayla Brenae, Ms Kristine, Nita Danielle and Ciara Anderson just to name a few, in roles such as their direct Talent Manager and Campaign Manager.
My experience in both of these roles comes from my time at Kensington Grey, an Influencer Marketing Agency representing some of the biggest black and brown creators in the industry. 
Aside from directly managing talent/creators, I’ve worked at Fleishman Hillard, a PR Agency as an Account Manager representing brands such Phillips, Capital One, Water Wipes and Shark Ninja building adhoc and year-long influencer campaigns for these brands through building scaled influencer campaigns and 360 PR and media plans.

<p> I have begun developing an interest in becoming a Web Developer and have set out on a journey to becoming a self-taught developer using resources through different bootcamps, youtube videos and online content creators. 
My goal is to practicing coding for 100 days consistently, so that I can begin my journey of becoming a Web Developer and shifting my career path as I embark on life in my 30's.

<p>Come along on this journey with me as I code for 100 days!</p>
